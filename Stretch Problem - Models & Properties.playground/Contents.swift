// MARK: - Instructions
/* Models & Properties
 
 Instructions :
 
 Open a new Swift playground. Create a Person class with three properties:
 
 name property whose type is String.
 favoriteColor property whose type is an optional String.
 favoriteMovie property whose type is an optional String.
 Create Memberwise Initializer:
 
 Create a custom initializer where you set the name.
 Call it:
 
 Then, outside of the Person class, create an instance of Person and initialize it with your name. Set either the favoriteColor OR favoriteMovie property.
 Print:
 
 Next, print out a description of the person's favorite things, being sure to properly handle the optionals beforehand.
 Also print out the optional property you didn't set and observe the result.

 Create a function that will print out a description of a person's favorite things, or say that the person doesn't like anything. This function should work properly whether or not the optional properties were set. Example printouts below
 
 Examples:
 
 "John's favorite color is blue."
 "John's favorite movie is Star Wars."
 "John's favorite color is blue and his favorite movie is Star Wars."
 "John doesn't like anything."
