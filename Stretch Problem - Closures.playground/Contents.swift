// MARK: - Instructions
/* Closures
 
 Instructions:

- User filter to create an array that contains all the numbers that are multiples of 3 from the numbersArray. Print your result.

- Find the largest number from the previous number array and then print it. Use reduce to solve. Print your result.

- Join all the string objects in the stringsArray into one string using reduce. Make sure spaces are in between each string. Print your result.

/* NOTE
 Swiftâ€™s various map functions are great to keep in mind when we need to transform sequences, or optionals, into a new form. Theyâ€™re also general patterns that are not unique to Swift, and learning how each of them works can let us unlock a whole suite of powerful functional programming features that can also result in simpler, more elegant code.
