// MARK: - Instructions
/*
 Instructions:

 - Create a protocol called Vehicle that requires a variable for speed as a Double, a variable for isMoving as a Bool, and a func startMoving() and func stopMoving().
 - Create two separate classes that conform to the Vehicle protocol (i.e. class LawnMower and class Truck). Your start and stop functions should simply check for whether or not the isMoving property is true or false, switch it to the opposite, and then print whether or not it is moving.
 - Create one instance of each of your two classes, and call your start and stop functions on them to be sure they work.
 - Notice that you have to write the same function in two distinct classes. Create an extension on your vehicle protocol and implement the two functions there. Now delete the two functions from your two classes. Notice that you do not have an error and that the functions still work.

 Black Diamond  ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž

 - Create a protocol Racer that inherits from your first protocol and adds a func race() -> Double.
 - Implement your race function in a protocol extension. It should return the time it takes for the vehicle the function was called on to travel 1000 meters.
 - Create two more classes that conform to Racer or make your existing vehicles conform to Racer. Create another function outside of your classes that will take in two Racer objects and return the winner.
